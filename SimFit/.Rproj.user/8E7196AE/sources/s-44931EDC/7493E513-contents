## What we do
We are a one-stop shop for maximizing information from hard-earned data.  We listen to wildlife professionals so we can build customized tools that provide the information needed to make difficult decisions, automate tedious tasks and defend management actions.  We emphasize data accessibility, transparency and repeatable analyses.    

Examples of tools developed with our collaborators include:

* Mobile data collection applications
* Web based data entry and validation tools
* Population models
* Automated harvest estimation (i.e. analysis of survey data)
* Demographic analyses
* Sightability estimation
* Tools to define wildlife populations in space
* Automation of complex GIS tasks
* Automated data download (e.g. MODIS, SNODAS, PRISM)
* Home range analyses
* Elicitation of expert opinion (e.g. Structured Decision Making)
* Data cleaning algorithms
* Data integrity checks
* Monitoring report generation (e.g. a list of telemetry frequencies currently monitored)

In building these tools, we have worked on a number of species at the state and regional level including:

* Elk
* Mule Deer
* White-tailed Deer
* Mountain Lions
* Sage-Grouse
* Axis Deer - in progress
* Bobcat - in progress
* Black Bear - in progress
* Bison - in progress

## Data Collection
We develop mobile applications for offline data collection using free and open source software.  These tools go a long way to preserve data integrity and accuracy without the hassle of a second data entry step.  When mobile applications are not desirable, web-based data entry offers a great alternative.  Web data entry is particularly powerful because it allows access to GIS, databases and custom validation of data entries.  Both methods are a significant improvement over Excel like spreadsheets not to mention they save time.

***

## Data Storage
Typically our collaborators house their own data, but if desired we have multiple data storage options available to us. We have agreements with The University of Montana that allow us to leverage high end computing hardware.  This option can result in significant savings over in house storage, but we understand the importance of data and maintaining control.

## Data Analyses and Dashboards
Our best known software, PopR, is a website that allow users to explore and analyze numerous types of data.  Examples of applications include tools to run analyses such as:

### Population Definition by Cluster Analysis
#### Spatial, GIS Operations
A seamless workflow means that everything happens in one place, including GIS.  No more transitions from one program to another.  No more wondering how an answer came to be.  All workflows are documented from beginning to end.  One piece of software, one answer.

### Dynamic Query Buildling for Flexible Data Exploration
#### Accessibility
No more waiting on that dude in IT.  Query your data how you want, when you want.  In this example, a dataset of harvest estimates is subset and summarized in complex, but realistic ways with just a few clicks of the mouse.

### Data Integrity Reports
#### Data Integrity - algorithmic checks and an interactive table allow the user to pinpoint errors in their database
In addition to analyses, we stress the importance of data integrity.  To this end, we have developed data integrity checks.  A typical output includes the results of a series of checks along with interactive tables that allow users to find errors in their data. While shown as an interactive tool this feature could also be automated and emails sent out so everyone knows the state of the data.

### Interactive Tables of Inputs
#### Transparency
What data goes into a model matters.  This is why the user can look at raw data inputs, summaries of the inputs, interact with their data and even download a copy.

### Customized Analyses
#### Statistics, not just descriptions of data, give deeper insights
#### Interactive plots and tables help users get to know their results
Cutting edge population models that allow users to evaluate the consequences of management actions before they occur.  We can also change the data to evaluate the predictive abilities of the models and test biological hypotheses about how populations grow.

Interactive plots let users go beyond canned reports and download just this or that plot to make the perfect report.

Some people like tables.  Like the plots, tables are interactive, downloadable and customizable in numerous ways.  We have also developed dynamic tables that allow creation of new variables from model estimates with measures of uncertainty.  We even have tables that allow data entry and editing.

## Reporting
Reports are completely customizable to agency needs.  Reports often include user inputs, plots, tables and some explanatory text.  In addition to the "canned" reports all plots and tables rendered within a website can be downloaded by the user, which many find helpful when designing their own reports.

***

## Security
Security is important to us.  We protect each agency website by using the https protocol, password protecting the site and routine monitoring of site traffic.  On our servers, we follow industry standards and can take enhanced security measures to meet your needs.  

***

### Intellectual Security
You own the data.  You use the data.  All we do is make data easier to work with, which is why we are usually co-authors (aka et al).  

***

## Life Ring
Because nothing lasts forever, we provide each collaborator with an exit strategy.  The exit strategy protects you and your data from the ups and downs of our company and our lives.  Others may act like they will be around forever, but whether we are or not you will have a plan and be able to continue using the software we develop together.  Think about the once ubiquitous companies like Blackberry that are now resigned to the shawdows or products like Word, which may change tomorrow without consideration for our needs.  We are planning ahead so your future is secure.

## Bugs, Documentation and Project Management
We use [git](https://git-scm.com/) for all of our projects and backup all code on [GitHub](https://github.com/), but don't worry if you don't know about that software. The important part is that these tools facilitate communication. We create wiki's that document the software, store presentations and serve as a general repository for helpful information related to using the websites.  Take a look at [Idaho Fish and Game's wiki](https://github.com/Huh/PopR_IDFG/wiki). We also make extensive use of GitHub's issue tracker.  As an example you can browse the open and closed issues on [South Dakota's issue tracker](https://github.com/Huh/PopR_SDGFP/issues). Recently we also started using project management software that allows our collaborators to prioritize the work we do. Having a collaborative way to easily set priorities and schedule tasks will give everyone a clear path of communication as well define expectations. In other words, we work for you and we give you the tools to pull the levers.

## Parting Comments

The techniques used to build these modules and workflows can be generalized to solve a variety of problems whether the focus is wildlife or not.  Our future will be defined by our collaborators and we look forward to further innovation and easier and more insightful interactions with data...yeah, we are geeks.
